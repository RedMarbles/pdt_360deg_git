If you want to build your own Debian package just do the following:

 * Make sure you have the dpkg-dev package installed

   apt-get install dpkg-dev 

   ... should do the job

 * Build the package

   In the base directory call

   dpkg-buildpackage

   This will produce a .deb file in ../

 * Install the package

   dpkg -i ../cudatemplates<some version stuff>.deb

Have fun!

Note: It should be possible to build packages on any debianish Linux distribution, e.g. Ubuntu.
